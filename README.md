# Game On: Sports Trivia Challenge
This repository contains code for making a sports trivia game. We have our protype, dictionary, and code. 
We used Python version 3.10 and PyCharm 2025.2.3.
You will need to have Git and a Github account in order to access the repository. You will also need to download Python and PyCharm. You will need to have installed the tkinter and random package. 

This is what the user will see when they finish playing a round of the trivia game.
